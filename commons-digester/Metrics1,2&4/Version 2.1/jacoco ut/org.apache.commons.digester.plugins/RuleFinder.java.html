/**
 * Each concrete implementation of RuleFinder is an algorithm for
 * locating a source of digester rules for a plugin. The algorithm may 
 * use info explicitly provided by the user as part of the plugin 
 * declaration, or not (in which case the concrete RuleFinder subclass
 * typically has Dflt as part of its name).
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Instances of this class can also be regarded as a Factory for RuleLoaders,
 * except that an instance of a RuleLoader is only created if the particular
 * finder algorithm can locate a suitable source of rules given the plugin
 * class and associated properties.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This is an abstract class rather than an interface in order to make
 * it possible to enhance this class in future without breaking binary
 * compatibility; it is possible to add methods to an abstract class, but
 * not to an interface.

     * Apply the finder algorithm to attempt to locate a source of

     * &lt;p&gt;
     * This method is invoked when a plugin is declared by the user, either
     * via an explicit use of PluginDeclarationRule, or implicitly via an
     * &quot;inline declaration&quot; where the declaration and use are simultaneous.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * If dynamic rules for the specified plugin class are located, then
     * the RuleFinder will return a RuleLoader object encapsulating those
     * rules, and this object will be invoked each time the user actually
     * requests an instance of the declared plugin class, to load the
     * custom rules associated with that plugin instance.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * If no dynamic rules can be found, null is returned. This is not an
     * error; merely an indication that this particular algorithm found
     * no matches.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The properties object holds any xml attributes the user may have
     * specified on the plugin declaration in order to indicate how to locate
     * the plugin rules.

     * of rules, but there is something invalid about that source.
