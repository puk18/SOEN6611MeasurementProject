/**
 * Simple utility class to assist in logging.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class is intended only for the use of the code in the plugins packages. No &quot;user&quot; code should use this package.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The Digester module has an interesting approach to logging: all logging should be done via the Log object stored on
 * the digester instance that the object *doing* the logging is associated with.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This is done because apparently some &quot;container&quot;-type applications such as Avalon and Tomcat need to be able to
 * configure different logging for different &lt;i&gt;instances&lt;/i&gt; of the Digester class which have been loaded from the same
 * ClassLoader [info from Craig McClanahan]. Not only the logging of the Digester instance should be affected; all
 * objects associated with that Digester instance should obey the reconfiguration of their owning Digester instance's
 * logging. The current solution is to force all objects to output logging info via a single Log object stored on the
 * Digester instance they are associated with.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Of course this causes problems if logging is attempted before an object &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; a valid reference to its owning
 * Digester. The getLogging method provided here resolves this issue by returning a Log object which silently discards
 * all logging output in this situation.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * And it also implies that logging filtering can no longer be applied to subcomponents of the Digester, because all
 * logging is done via a single Log object (a single Category). C'est la vie...
 *
 * @since 1.6
